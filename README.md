A news website.\
Functionalities I've implemented so far:
* Displaying a list of news (with desired information), ordered by date descending, on home page
* Listing all categories in sidebar, and being able to display all news that belong to chosen category
* Separate log in for users and administrators
* Sign up
* Log out
* Client side validation
* Server side validation
* SQL injection prevention
* Session
* Showing username of the person who logged in on each page
* Showing sign in options only when there is no person logged in
* If a person is logged in, show log out option\
I've also created the database and tables, and worked on design.\
Functionalities I need to implemet:
* Pagination system
* Displaying a chosen article (halfway there)
* Users can add comments to articles; they can also delete their own comments
* Administrators can add comments to articles; they can delete any comment
* Administrators can add a new article (as writers)
* Administrators can delete articles
* Cookies
